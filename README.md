# Project #2: Student Store

## Overview

Selling merchandise in the modern era requires digital solutions. For this project, you'll be tasked with designing and constructing an online student store for the College of Codepath. The application entails a frontend user interface for potential customers to peruse the goods, and a backend API to handle data management. The API will be built with Node and Express and the UI will be built with React.


#### WEEK 2 Frontend Previews

- [X] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Passing Automated Tests

The following specifications were met on the Express backend and the React frontend.

### React UI

**App.jsx**

  - [ ] The core App component that contains the routes for the app and does the initial data fetching
  - [ ] Renders a `BrowserRouter` component that contains a `Routes` component with the following routes:
    - [ ] `/` - Should render the `Home.jsx` component
    - [ ] `/products/:productId` - should render the `ProductDetail` component
    - [ ] `*` - anything else should render the `NotFound` component
  - [ ] Renders the `Navbar` component on every route
  - [ ] Renders the `Sidebar` component on every route
  - [ ] Should create **at least** the following state variables:
    - [ ] `products` - an array of product objects that is initially empty.
    - [ ] `isFetching` - a boolean value representing whether or not the App is currently fetching the `products` from the API.
    - [ ] `error` - a variable used to display a message when something goes wrong with the API requests.
    - [ ] `isOpen` - a boolean value representing whether or not the `Sidebar.jsx` is in the open or closed state.
    - [ ] `shoppingCart` - should store state for the active user's shopping cart (items they want to purchase and the quantity of each item).
      - [ ] Use whatever data type works best here, but make sure the format the `shoppingCart` as an array before passing it to other components.
      - [ ] When passed down to other components as a prop, it should formatted as an array of objects.
      - [ ] Each object in the array should have two fields:
        - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased.
        - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
    - [ ] `checkoutForm` - the user's information that will be sent to the API when they checkout.
  - [ ] Leverage the `useEffect` hook to ensure that when the `App.jsx` component is mounted to the screen...
    - [ ] It should make a `GET` request to the API's `/store` endpoint with the `axios.get` method.
    - [ ] When the request completes successfully, it should store the `products` returned by the response in state.
    - [ ] If the request does not complete successfully, or there are no `products` found in the response,
            it should create an error message and store it in the `error` state variable.
  - [ ] The `App.jsx` component should define handler functions to be passed as props to the `Home` and `ProductDetail` components.
    - [ ] Define as many as are needed.
    - [ ] At minimum, **create these five handlers**:
      - [ ] The **`handleOnToggle`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should toggle the open/closed state of the `Sidebar`.
      - [ ] The **`handleAddItemToCart`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should accept a single argument - `productId`
        - [ ] It should add that product to the `shoppingCart` if it doesn't exist, and set its quantity to `1`.
        - [ ] If it does exist, it should increase the quantity by `1`.
        - [ ] It should add the price of the product to the total price of the `shoppingCart`.
      - [ ] The **`handleRemoveItemFromCart`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should accept a single argument - `productId`
        - [ ] It should decrease the quantity of the item in the `shoppingCart` by `1`, but only if it already exists.
        - [ ] If it doesn't exist, the function should do nothing.
        - [ ] If the new quantity is `0`, it should remove the item from the `shoppingCart`
      - [ ] The **`handleOnCheckoutFormChange`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should receive two arguments:
          - [ ] `name` - the `name` attribute of the input being updated
          - [ ] `value` - the new value to set for that input
        - [ ] It should update the `checkoutForm` object with the new value from the correct input(s)
      - [ ] The **`handleOnSubmitCheckoutForm`** function. When called...
        - [ ] It should submit the user's order to the API
        - [ ] To submit the user's order, it should leverage the `axios.post` method to send a `POST` request to the `/store` endpoint.
        - [ ] The body of that `POST` request should be an object with two fields:
          - [ ] The `user` field:
            - [ ] Should be an object containing `name` and `email` properties
            - [ ] Each property should be set to the correct value found in the `checkoutForm`
          - [ ] The `shoppingCart` field:
            - [ ] Should contain the user's order formatted as an array of objects.
            - [ ] Each object in the array should have two fields:
              - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased.
              - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
            - [ ] Don't include the `total` price here, since we'll be calculating that on the backend. Remember to never trust the client!

  - [ ] Have a `server.js` file that starts the app by listening on port `3001`.

**Models** - The API should use a `Store` model that handles the following
  - [ ] List all products currently in the `db.json` file
  - [ ] Fetch a single product by its id
  - [ ] Create a purchase order

**Routes** - The API should contain a route mounted at the `/store` endpoint
  - [ ] It should respond to `GET` requests to `/store` with an array of all products in the store in this format: `{ "products": products }`
  - [ ] It should respond to `GET` requests to `/store/:productId` with a single product based on the product's id using this JSON format: `{ "product": product }`
  - [ ] It should allow `POST` requests to the `/store` endpoint:
    - [ ] The endpoint should create purchase orders for users and save them to the `db.json` file
    - [ ] The endpoint should accept a request body that contains `shoppingCart` and `user` fields.
      - [ ] The `shoppingCart` field should contain the user's order.
        - [ ] This should be an array of objects.
        - [ ] Each object in the array should have two fields:
          <!-- - [ ] The `item` field should store an object of the item being purchased -->
          - [ ] The `itemId` field should store the `id` of the item being purchased
          - [ ] The `quantity` field should store a number representing how many of that item the user is purchasing.
      - [ ] The `user` field should contain the name and email of the person placing the order.
      - [ ] When either the `shoppingCart` or `user` fields are missing, it should throw a `400` error.
      - [ ] If there are duplicate items in the `shoppingCart`, it should throw a `400` error.
      - [ ] If either the `quantity` or `itemId` field is missing for any of the items in the `shoppingCart`, a `400` error should be thrown.
      - [ ] When both are there, it should calculate the total cost of all the items (including quantities), add a `8.75%` tax to the total, and create a new purchase object containing 6 required fields and 1 optional field:
        - **required**:
          - [ ] `id` - the new `id` of the purchase should be equal to one more than the current number of existing purchases
          - [ ] `name` - the name of the user making the purchase
          - [ ] `email` - the email of the user making the purchase
          - [ ] `order` - the `shoppingCart` value sent in the `POST` request
          - [ ] `total` - the calculated total of the order
          - [ ] `createdAt` - a string representation of the date and time when the order was placed
        - **optional**:
          - [ ] `receipt` - text describing the order (what might go on a receipt)
      - [ ] It should then send a JSON response back to the client with the new purchase like so: `{ "purchase": purchase }`. The response should have a `201` status code for a resource created action.


### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Week2: Initially, I felt most unprepared to complete the routing with BrowserRouter, Routes, and Links. Although it ended up being more straightforward than I had anticipated, it still felt intimidating since we weren't able to cover it during the labs. The API call with axios was another instance of this since I didn't really practice using useEffect hooks before the project. Overall, though, I felt like the labs did cover the major parts of the assignment such as incorporating controlled text inputs, filtering objects, and passing props between components. One thing of note is that this project had a lot more components than the labs with a lot more props being passed between them. So, I definitely still felt this was a step up from the labs as I had to take extra care in making sure that all the necessary props were passed properly.

Week 3: For week 3, I ended up referencing the labs a lot, especially the bank of CodePath lab because it provided a really good "standard" for my project on writing get and post requests. I would say that I felt most confused when I was writing the model functions for the project, but looking at week 3's labs helped clarify what functions I should be writing and how I should go about writing them (e.g, what built-ins to use, how to access local databases). Another aspect that I found a little daunting was accessing and using POST request responses. We mostly practiced making GET requests to retrieve data, so doing the POST request and receiving data back was a little strange at first. 

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
Week 2: Currently, I have yet to properly implement some parts of the shopping cart and the checkout form components, so that would be the first thing I would be working on as I start on Week 3. In terms of additional features, I hope to add the top bar navigation links and create the "Not Found" display. The UI is currently not great in terms of spacing and interaction, so that is also definitely something I want to continue to improve over the course of Week 3 before I submit the final project. In terms of specific functionalities, one thing I would like to change is to make my category filtering be more reusable by changing how the "All categories" button works. Lastly, my site is not very robust and is heavily reliant on all the data getting passed to its props being formatted in a very specific way, so it probably would not handle errors very well. So, to improve my site, I will have to go back in and make sure that the components will still render without errors even with "incorrect" or missing props through adding default values for my components.

Week 3: At this point, I've been able to accomplish some of the features that I mentioned in my week 2 reflection (shopping cart, checkout form, top bar navigation, "not found" display, UI changes), which is really great! However, the other changes mentioned in last week's reflection still stand. I think I've gotten better at making components more error-resistant since I've been more intentional about it. So, I think the components I worked on this week are OK, but I would still need to go back and edit all my other components. Another thing I would do is clean up the function I wrote to update the database to include new purchases. It requred a lot of logic that got kind of confusing since there were so many things to consider, so I think I would want to spend some time working to optimize it. Additionally, at this point, there are still 2 more stretch features I can do: creating a list of past purchases, and searching them by email. Hopefully, this is something I can get done over the weekend.


* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Week 2: One thing that I did not anticipate is how long it would take to do the styling for the website. Although it was not necessarily difficult, it definitely takes some time to get things in the right places, and I ended up spending a lot of my work time on the CSS and I did not make as much progress as I had hoped. Another obstacle I faced with this project was with working with state variables. When I was working on the shopping cart, I had a lot of trouble updating the cart because it would change a step late. I was able to fiture out my issue, but I realized that I did not understand how state variables updated with the rest of the page as well as I had thought, and I had to do some more research on this in order to get my project going. Lastly, when thinking about some of the features my peers incorporated in their projects, I feel that most of the demos I saw generally just followed the same functionalities listed in the requirements. But, I noticed that people really customized their UI, so I would like to incorporate some of the design decisions I saw, such as a sidebar for the category filters.

Week 3: A major point of frustration was setting up the backend server. I forgot that we had to restart the server, and I struggled for a while because I thought my backend wasn't working at all when in reality, I just needed to restart the server. I ended up wasting a lot of time because of this, which was really frustrating. Luckily, the rest of the backend was not TOO difficult to implement minus the function to update the database for the POST request. One thing I saw during demos that I thought was really neat was creating a drop-down filter for the past orders. Although I did not implement the associated stretch feature, I think a drop-down filter would be a good addition for the product grid and is something I could do for that stretch feature if I'm able to get to it.

### Shout out

I'd like to shoutout all of my podmates: Angelo, Charidi, Evans, and Travis; it was great working with one group for a couple days! There were a lot of instances where I got frustrated with bugs in my code, and they provided a fresh set of eyes that helped me identify what was going on and get past those setbacks.
